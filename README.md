parallax challenge Becode 17/11/21 - 19/11/21

## Goal of the Challenge
>Tim, our coach wants us to try create our own inspired project, by actively making the requirements of the challenge very achieveable in a 3 day window. 
>He's curious as to what we can come up with in respect to additional features and for us to apply some of our other lessons and personal interest in coding.
>He gave us some ideas as to what to do with the parallax challenge and wants us to challenge outselves. 

## My take on the challenge
>Drawing inspitating from some games I want to create a round-type parallax effect where there is a character moving in the direction the player steers. 
>Ideally Steering will be able to be done through both arrowkeys and mouse. 
>That's the idea, it's quite ambitious as it requires a lot of functonality to be dynamic. And the parallax to work that way. If for whatever reason i do not succeed in creating a globe i'll create a downhill game with either bmx or snowboards. 

## Time-spending
>first of all make the parallax work ASAP
>after that we'll see what the next step will be.
>I'll need help in the approach to the challenge so i'll ask help where needed.
